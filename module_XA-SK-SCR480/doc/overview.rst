--------------------------

This slice provides power supply electronics and a 40-pin ZIF connector for the included LCD, plus a low cost resistive touch screen controller that interfaces to the LCD and to the XCore via a 2-wire interface. The touch functionality is only accesible when the Slice is placed in the TRIANGLE slot.

The parallel RGB interface is driven directly from the xSOFTip LCD controller component running on teh XCore using 1 16 bit port and 4 1-bit ports. The xSOFTip LCD controller is capable of driving screens with resolutions up to 800x600 (in conjunction with the XA-SK-SDRAM Slice Card and xSOFTip SDRAM controller component).
