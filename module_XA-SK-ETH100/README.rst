The Ethernet Slice Card provides 100Mbps Ethernet connectivity to Slicekit. Combined with Ethernet xSOFTip, it allows XCORE multicore microcontrollers to be used in any embedded Ethernet system. You might want a TCP stack and webserver in your system, or maybe you need to provide highly responsive, low latency command and control over UDP, or even you own custom protocol.  You might even want two Ethernet ports - XCORE gives you the flexibility to do it.   HELLO POSSIBILITY!
