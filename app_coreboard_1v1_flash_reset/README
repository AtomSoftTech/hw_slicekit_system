This program is a workaround for a PCB issue on the 1v1 L2 core board.

If you flash a program that disables SPI flash then you will not be
able to use xflash afterwards since the flash remains disabled even
after system reset is asserted.

Running this program will re-enable the flash. After running it you
will be able to use xflash again.
